This software will eventually be licensed under the GPL, but until
the terms of Canonhack.com are met or the expiration of this agreement,
the software is being distributed with additional restrictions.

By downloading this software you agree to:

1. not submit derived works to canonhack.com
2. not redistribute the software without approval of the team leader
3. proportionally divide any proceeds from canonhack.com

This agreement will expire on 31 December 2009, when a successful
hack is submitted to canonhack.com, or when Canon releases a firmware
that provides the desired functionality, which ever comes first.
Once the agreement expires the software will be released under
the GPL and all additional restrictions will be removed.

The division of any pledged funds from canonhack.com will be based on the
level of contribution by the different developers.  It is not known
how much of the pledged amount will actually be contributed once
we are successful.
