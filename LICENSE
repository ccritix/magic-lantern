The "5D Mark Free" software will eventually be licensed under
the GPL, but until the terms of canonhack.com are met or the
expiration of this agreement, the software is being distributed
with additional restrictions to protect our ability to win the
award.

By downloading the software you agree to:

1. not submit derived works to canonhack.com
2. not redistribute the software without approval of the team leader
3. proportionally divide any proceeds from canonhack.com
4. not distribute any Canon proprietary code without permission
5. hold the team leader and all other developers harmless

This agreement will expire on 31 December 2009, when a successful
hack is submitted to canonhack.com, or when Canon releases a firmware
that provides the desired functionality, which ever comes first.
Once the agreement expires the software will be released under
the GPL and all additional restrictions will be removed.

The division of any pledged funds from canonhack.com will be based
on the level of contribution by the different developers.  The team
leader will have final authority as to the division of the funds.
It is not known how much of the pledged amount will actually be
contributed once we are successful.

This software has the potential to damage or destroy your camera.
There is no warranty provided and you hold full responsibility if
you damage your camera while experimenting with it.  To quote jwz,
"if it breaks, you get to keep both pieces".
