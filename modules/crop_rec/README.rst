Crop mode recording
===================

This alters the 1080p and 720p video modes, transforming them
into 3x (1:1) crop modes, by tweaking the sensor registers.

All other behaviors are the same as with Canon's 1080p/720p
implementation: resolution, H.264, RAW, audio, HDMI, preview,
overlays and so on.
