Display based ROM dumper
========================

This module is only to be used with the portable ROM dumper
in the recovery branch of Magic Lantern. So it is possible
to use a full-featured camera to read out the other camera's
ROM using only its display.
The counterpart is disp_dump() and shows dots on screen for the
content of the ROM to be dumped.
