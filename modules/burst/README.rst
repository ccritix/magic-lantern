:Summary: Tweaks related to burst (continuous) shooting mode

* Image previews while shooting a burst sequence
* Option to limit the number of pictures in a burst sequence

TODO
----

Easy:

* Reduce picture quality when buffer gets full (old AutoBurstPicQ)
* Display all images from a burst sequence on the same screen

Difficult:

* Add some delay between the images
* Prevent camera from becoming unresponsive when buffer gets full
  (5D3 sometimes does this and refuses to take any more pictures
  until the buffer is completely empty - why?)
* ETTR during burst sequences
