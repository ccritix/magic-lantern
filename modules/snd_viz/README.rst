:Summary: Adds sound FFT/scope views
:Website: http://www.magiclantern.fm/

FFT Lines/Bars:
Show audio input signal's FFT view as lines or single bars.

Waterfall:
Show input signal's FFT view as waterfall diagram that scrolls down.

L/R correlation:
Prints a canvas that shows every audio sample on X/Y according to the amplitude.
For a 2-channel mono signal you will get a diagonal line as the gray one in background.
If there is some difference between the channels, the diagonal line will be skewed and noisy.
If the diagonal line is rotated, then one channel is inverted.
