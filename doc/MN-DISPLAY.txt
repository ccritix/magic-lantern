Options for display (most of them are for LiveView).

.. _contrast:

LV contrast
```````````

Adjusts the contrast in LiveView. It doesn't affect recording. This helps when focusing with very flat picture styles.

Values: Normal (no effect), High, Very high, Zero, Very low, Low.

.. _saturation:

LV saturation
`````````````

Adjusts the saturation in LiveView. It doesn't affect recording. This helps you focus without being distracted by color.

Values: Normal (no effect), High, Very high, Zero (grayscale).

.. _night vision:
.. _display gain:

LV display gain
```````````````

{{ nightdemo.jpg?200}}

Photo mode only: this feature increases the brightness in LiveView, making it usable in very dark scenes (where Canon's LiveView would be pitch black). Combine this with FPS override for better low-light performance.

For movie mode, use ML digital ISOs for a similar effect.

Color Scheme
````````````

This affects the colors and brightness of the on-screen information (including LiveView overlays, Canon menus and ML menus).
Range from: Bright (default), Dark, Bright Gray, Dark Gray, Dark Red, Dark Green. Tip: dark themes may reduce the eye strain during night shooting.

Clear Overlays
``````````````
 
Clear bitmap overlays from LiveView display.
 
* ``HalfShutter``: Hold the shutter half-pressed, or the ``*`` button, or DOF preview for around 1 second
  to clear all the overlays from the Live View display (audio, zebra, crops, shutter speeds...).
  
  Tip: assign autofocus to ``*`` button (from Custom Functions, set ``Shutter/AE lock button`` = ``AE lock/AF``).
  
* ``WhenIdle``: In this mode, all the overlays are erased from the screen (100% clean display) when the camera is idle (i.e. you don't press any buttons).

* ``Always``: In this mode, all the overlays are erased from the screen; you will have to change shooting settings blindly. You can still use the menus.
  
  Tip: this feature may be useful with [[External Recorders]], since it removes the focus box and other graphics from the display.

Focus box (LV)
``````````````

With this setting you can choose to show the Focus box in liveview or hide it when not needed.

Force HDMI-VGA
``````````````

This option will force a low-resolution mode on HDMI displays (720x480), which avoids black screen when you start/stop recording.

Screen layout settings...
`````````````````````````

Screen orientation, positioning fine tuning, adjustments for external monitors...

Screen Layout
"""""""""""""

Choose screen layout (position of ML top and bottom bars), for different cameras or for external monitors.
  
Top/bottom layouts:
  
* Inside 3:2: default layout for 3:2-screen cameras (550D and newer).
* Inside 16:10: for 16:10 HDMI monitors.
* Inside 16:9: for 16:9 HDMI monitors.
* 4:3 movie (for 5D Mark II, 500D and 50D in movie mode).
  
Bottom-only layouts:

* Under 3:2: useful for 4:3-screen cameras (500D, 50D, 5D Mark 2) in photo mode.
* Under 16:9: suitable for low-resolution external monitors and for 4:3-screen cameras in movie mode.


Image position
""""""""""""""

This may make the image better visible from different angles (especially on cameras without flip-out screen).


UpsideDown mode
"""""""""""""""

{{ up_down.jpg?200}}

This mode is useful if you want to mount your camera upside-down.


Auto Mirroring
""""""""""""""

For cameras with flip-out LCD, this options prevents mirroring the display when you open it at 180 degrees.

Display: Normal/Reverse/Mirror
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

For cameras with flip-out LCD, you may select a different flipping/mirroring option.

Level Indicator (60D)
`````````````````````

Shows if the picture levels with the horizon. Can be used while recording.

Kill Canon GUI
``````````````

For 50D only: disable Canon graphics elements to avoid conflicts with ML graphics in LiveView.
 
* ``Idle/Menus``: only enable Canon graphics when some transparent menu from LiveView is active.
* ``Idle/Menus+Keys``: only enable Canon graphics when you press some keys or navigate the transparent menus from LiveView.
