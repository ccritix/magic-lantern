Adjusting the exposure parameters. Most of these settings only work in Manual (photo and video), and some of them work in P, Av and Tv too.

WhiteBalance
````````````

Advanced white balance control. The preferred method is Kelvin white balance (range: 1500...15000K).
  
Submenu options:
  
* Kelvin white balance;
* WBShift G/M: Green-Magenta white balance shift. Useful for fluorescent lighting;
#* WBShift B/A: Blue-Amber white balance shift. 1 unit = 5 mireks on Kelvin axis, according to `this post <http://www.openphotographyforums.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-5450.html>`_;
* Custom RGB multipliers: fine-tune custom white balance;
* Black level: this parameter is applied on RAW data, before applying white balance. Adjust it if you have problems with green or magenta shadows;
* Auto adjust Kelvin + G/M: in LiveView, ML will compute the white balance for the current scene, using the center (200x200 pixels rectangle) as reference gray.


.. _ISO:

ISO
```

Advanced ISO control.

Color coding:

* orange = Canon ISO with good noise or dynamic range characteristics (100, 160, 200, 320 ... 3200).
* green = ISO with negative digital gain applied via DIGIC (80, 90, 160, 320 - obtained by setting ML digital ISO to a negative value). These can have lower noise and/or better highlight rolloff than their Canon equivalents.
* red = ISO with positive digital gain (avoid these values).

Submenu options:

* Equivalent ISO;
* Analog ISO;
* Canon digital ISO;
* ML digital ISO (DIGIC) - in movie mode: negative values will reduce noise, but may cause color issues in highlights. This feature enables ISO 50, ISO 51200 and many other intermediate or astronomical ISOs.
* Display Gain (night vision) - in photo mode, for previewing night scenes;
* Highlight Tone Priority (which increases dynamic range by 1 stop in movie mode);
* ISO selection (Canon ISOs or ML ISOs) - only used in movie mode;

.. _shutter:

Shutter
```````

Fine-tune shutter speed.

* When exposure override is enabled, you can adjust it in 1/8-stop increments (movie mode only).
* In photo mode, Magic Lantern displays shutter values rounded to 2 significant digits (e.g. 1/50 may be displayed by ML as 1/48). This is not a bug.
* In movie mode, shutter values are displayed with 3 decimal places (for example, in PAL mode, Canon uses 1/33.333 to avoid flicker).
* To use shutter speeds normally not available in Canon firmware (like 1/25 or 1/8000 in movie mode), enable `exposure override`_.

Aperture
````````

Adjust aperture. When `exposure override`_ is enabled, you can adjust it in 1/8-stop increments (movie mode only).

PictureStyle
````````````

Change picture style or adjust its parameters.
  
REC PicStyle
````````````

You can use a different picture style when recording (toggled automagically). May be useful with flat picture styles.

.. _exposure override:

Exp.Override
````````````

This mode bypasses Canon exposure limitations (for ISO, Tv, Av). It enables:
 
* Manual video exposure controls in cameras without it (500D, 50D, 1100D).
* 1/25s in movie mode (24p/25p) -> 1/3 stops better in low light.
* 1/8000s in movie mode, `useful for slow motion <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztuUh3bgqA>`_.
* ISO 12800 is allowed in movie mode on 60D and 600D.
* Full-time DOF preview in photo mode, without blocking certain keys.

Settings:

* OFF: Canon default exposure mode.
* ON: ML overrides exposure values (change them from Expo menu).
* Auto: ML enables it only when needed:

  - For 500D, 50D, 1100D: in movie mode, to enable manual exposure controls.
  - For 60D: in Manual mode with a manual lens, to fix the `LiveView underexposure bug <http://groups.google.com/group/ml-devel/browse_thread/thread/f1c9cb4ff163808c>`_.
  - For 550D/60D/600D/5D2: when you select a shutter speed, aperture or ISO value which is not available in standard firmware (e.g. 1/25s or 1/8000s in movie mode).

Side effect: in photo mode, anything slower than 1/25 seconds will be underexposed in LiveView.


LV Display
``````````
Selects or displays LiveView display type:

* Photo display, with exposure simulation
* Photo display, without exposure simulation (for framing and for flash photography)
* Movie display.
