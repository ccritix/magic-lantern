Important notes
===============

* **EyeFi cards will not work**; you will have to use SD / SDHC / SDXC cards.

* If you have a bootable SD card and have the ``BOOTDISK`` flag set in the camera (which the installer does), and you do not have an ``AUTOEXEC.BIN`` file on the card the camera **WILL NOT BOOT**! It will hang and not wake up until the battery is removed.

* If you encounter a "locked up" camera, **quickly remove the battery**.

* When in doubt, remove the battery and reboot.

* **And, remember that this software can damage or destroy your camera.**

Introduction
============

There are 2 ways of running user code on Canon DSLR cameras:

1. using the update process with a ``.fir`` file, which must be digitally signed.

2. using the bootdisk process: the ``autoexec.bin`` file is loaded and executed. 
   This file does not have to be signed, but the bootdisk flag must be enabled in the camera.

With great power comes great responsibility!
============================================

Before installing Magic Lantern, you need to:

* Know how to use a computer (how to download a file, how to unzip an archive, how to open a PDF document...)
* `Know your camera. <http://blog.epicedits.com/2007/11/12/how-well-do-you-really-know-your-camera/>`_ Please don't ask us how to change ISO in video mode or what is Highlight Tone Priority. Magic Lantern `is a tool for power users <http://groups.google.com/group/ml-devel/msg/95e8e9d468eaf624>`_, not a cool toy for beginners. We recommend you to use your camera for a few months (or more!) before even thinking of installing third-party firmware.
* Do your research. Read the `user guide <http://magiclantern.wikia.com/wiki/Unified/UserGuide>`_ and the [[FAQ]], explore the `wiki <http://magiclantern.wikia.com/wiki/Special:AllPages>`_ and the `forums <http://magiclantern.wikia.com/wiki/Unified#Magic_Lantern_Community>`_.
* Be patient. Magic Lantern is actually very easy to use once you know the basics.

First-time installation 
=======================

Step 0. Downloading
-------------------

* Download `latest stable release <http://magiclantern.wikia.com/wiki/Unified#Downloads>`_

* Read the release notes and the discussion thread from the download page. 

Step 1. Preparing your camera
-----------------------------

* Fully charge your battery.

* Remove any accessories from your camera (such as battery grip or external flash).

* Make sure you have a simple SD/SDHC card for first-time install (SDXC will not work).

* Make sure you have a `SD card reader <http://amzn.to/oHENg3>`_; you won't be able to copy ML files via USB cable.

.. _these links:

* Upgrade your Canon firmware:

  - for **Canon 550D / T2i / Kiss X4**: upgrade to firmware `1.0.9 <http://web.canon.jp/imaging/eosd/firm-e/eosdigital7/firmware.html>`_
  - for **Canon 60D**: upgrade to firmware `1.1.0 <http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/cameras/slr_cameras/eos_60d#DriversAndSoftware>`_
  - for **Canon 600D / T3i / Kiss X5**: upgrade to firmware `1.0.1 <http://www.canon.co.uk/Support/Consumer_Products/products/cameras/Digital_SLR/EOS_600D.aspx?DLtcmuri=tcm:14-839391&page=1&type=download>`_
  - for **Canon 50D**: upgrade to firmware `1.0.8 <http://www.canon-europe.com/Support/Consumer_Products/products/cameras/Digital_SLR/EOS_50D.aspx?DLtcmuri=tcm:13-845724&page=1&type=download>`_

* Rotate your mode dial to **Manual (M)** position.

* Restore your camera to default settings (``Clear all camera settings``, ``Wrench 3`` menu) 

Step 2. Installation
--------------------

* Format the SD card **from the camera** (low level, from Wrench 1 menu).

* Unzip all the files from from Magic Lantern zip archive on the root of your SD card.

* Launch the **Firmware Update** process. For this, start the camera and select ``Firmware ver 1.x.x`` from the ``Wrench 3`` menu.

* The installer (``ml-*.fir``) will perform two actions:

  - enables the ``BOOTDISK`` flag in NVRAM by calling the ``EnableBootDisk()`` function from Canon firmware. This change is persistent, but it can be reverted easily.
  - (for all cameras except 50D) makes the card bootable, by writing the ``BOOTDISK`` and ``EOS_DEVELOP`` strings on the SD card according to [[Bootdisk]] page. 

* Once you see the green confirmation screen, restart your camera.

* 50D only: **make the card bootable** with a special utility: `EOSCard <http://pel.hu/down/EOScard.exe>`_ for Windows, `MacBoot <http://www.zenoshrdlu.com/macboot/macboot.html>`_ for Mac, or `make_bootable.sh <http://groups.google.com/group/ml-devel/browse_thread/thread/1161d4e6e93232de/41a65807171f71a0>`_ for Mac/Linux in command line.

Installing Magic Lantern on other cards
=======================================

* If you use **SD/SDHC** cards, you may simply **repeat Step 2** on every card you would like to use Magic Lantern.

* If you use **SDXC** cards, or if you prefer to skip the firmware update step and prepare all your cards from the PC, you may copy ML files on your card and make it bootable with a special utility: `EOSCard <http://pel.hu/down/EOScard.exe>`_ for Windows, `MacBoot <http://www.zenoshrdlu.com/macboot/macboot.html>`_ for Mac, or `make_bootable.sh <http://groups.google.com/group/ml-devel/browse_thread/thread/1161d4e6e93232de/41a65807171f71a0>`_ for Mac/Linux in command line.

Updating Magic Lantern
======================

* Bookmark this page ([[Unified#Downloads]]) and check for updates periodically.

* To install an updated version, just unzip (or copy) all Magic Lantern files on your SD card and overwrite the old ones.

**Don't just delete the Magic Lantern files from the card! If you do, the camera will freeze at startup and you'll have to take the battery out.**

Uninstalling ML from one card
-------------------------------

* Format that card from the camera (select this option: ``Format card, remove Magic Lantern``) and reboot. Your camera will load the original firmware when you use that card.

Uninstalling ML from the camera
-------------------------------

* With a Magic Lantern card, launch the ``Firmware Update`` process and follow the instructions on-screen.

Troubleshooting
===============

* **If the camera asks for a firmware update**, place Canon firmware on the card. (it may happen on 60D `when the FIR is started with display off <https://bitbucket.org/hudson/magic-lantern/issue/614/no-green-confirmation-screen-on-60d>`_)
* **If the card LED blinks continuously after running Firmware Upgrade**, it's because Magic Lantern did not recognize the firmware version. To fix it, install the official Canon firmware upgrade from `these links`_, even if you already have the correct version number.
* **If the screen does not turn on, but autofocus works**, remove the battery and format the card. This happens when the card is bootable, but autoexec.bin is not there.
* **Check if all doors are closed.** The camera will not boot if any of the SD card or battery doors are open !
* **If the camera does not boot** (seems dead), **remove the battery and the card**. Then put the battery back and try to boot the camera without card. Then put a formatted card in the camera and try to boot **without** Magic Lantern. Only after you are sure the camera is OK, you can try to see what's wrong with Magic Lantern.
* **DO NOT use a bootable card without a working autoexec.bin on it!** If you do, remove the battery immediately, switching the camera off is not enough !!!
* Check the `issue tracker <https://bitbucket.org/hudson/magic-lantern/issues issue tracker>`_ for similar problems; if you can't find the solution, create a new issue there.
