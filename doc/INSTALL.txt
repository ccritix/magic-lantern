Important notes
===============

* **EyeFi cards will not work**; you will have to use SD / SDHC / SDXC cards.

* If you have a bootable SD card and have the ``BOOTDISK`` flag set in the camera (which the installer does), and you do not have an ``AUTOEXEC.BIN`` file on the card the camera **WILL NOT BOOT**! It will hang and not wake up until the battery is removed.

* If you encounter a "locked up" camera, **quickly remove the battery**.

* When in doubt, remove the battery and reboot.

* **And, remember that this software can damage or destroy your camera.**

Introduction
============

There are 2 ways of running user code on Canon DSLR cameras:

1. using the update process with a ``.fir`` file, which must be digitally signed.

2. using the bootdisk process: the ``autoexec.bin`` file is loaded and executed. 
   This file does not have to be signed, but the bootdisk flag must be enabled in the camera.

First-time installation 
=======================

Step 0. Downloading
-------------------

* Download `latest stable release <http://magiclantern.wikia.com/wiki/Unified#Downloads>`_

* Read the release notes and the discussion thread from the download page. 

Step 1. Preparing your camera
-----------------------------

* Fully charge your battery.

* Remove any accessories from your camera (such as battery grip or external flash).

* Make sure you have a simple SD/SDHC card for first-time install (SDXC will not work).

* Make sure you have a `SD card reader <http://amzn.to/oHENg3>`_; you won't be able to copy ML files via USB cable.

* If your firmware version is not the same as the one required by Magic Lantern, upgrade:

  - for **Canon 550D / T2i / Kiss X4**: upgrade to firmware `1.0.9 <http://web.canon.jp/imaging/eosd/firm-e/eosdigital7/firmware.html>`_
  - for **Canon 60D**: upgrade to firmware `1.1.0 <http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/cameras/slr_cameras/eos_60d#DriversAndSoftware>`_
  - for **Canon 600D / T3i / Kiss X5**: upgrade to firmware `1.0.1 <http://www.canon.co.uk/Support/Consumer_Products/products/cameras/Digital_SLR/EOS_600D.aspx?DLtcmuri=tcm:14-839391&page=1&type=download>`_

* Rotate your mode dial to **Manual (M)** position (550D, 600D) or **Bulb (B)** position (60D)

* Restore your camera to default settings (``Clear all camera settings``, ``Wrench 3`` menu) 

Step 2. Installation
--------------------

* Format the SD card **from the camera** (low level, from Wrench 1 menu).

* Unzip all the files from from Magic Lantern zip archive on the SD card.

* Launch the **Firmware Update** process. For this, start the camera and select ``Firmware ver 1.x.x`` from the ``Wrench 3`` menu.

* The installer (``ml-*.fir``) will perform two actions:

  - enables the ``BOOTDISK`` flag in NVRAM by calling the ``EnableBootDisk()`` function from Canon firmware. This change is persistent, but it can be reverted easily.
  - makes the card bootable, by writing the ``BOOTDISK`` and ``EOS_DEVELOP`` strings on the SD card according to [[Bootdisk]] page. 

* Once you see the green confirmation screen, restart your camera. Done.

Installing Magic Lantern on other cards
=======================================

* If you use **SD/SDHC** cards, you may simply **repeat Step 2** on every card you would like to use Magic Lantern.

* If you use **SDXC** cards, or if you prefer to skip the firmware update step and prepare all your cards from the PC, you may copy ML files on your card and make it bootable with a special utility: `EOSCard <http://pel.hu/down/EOScard.exe>`_ for Windows, `MacBoot <http://www.zenoshrdlu.com/macboot/macboot.html>`_ for Mac, or `make_bootable.sh <http://groups.google.com/group/ml-devel/browse_thread/thread/1161d4e6e93232de/41a65807171f71a0>`_ for Mac/Linux in command line.

Updating Magic Lantern
======================

* Bookmark this page ([[Unified#Downloads]]) and check for updates periodically.

* To install an updated version, just unzip all Magic Lantern files on your SD card and overwrite the old ones.

Uninstalling Magic Lantern
==========================

**Don't just delete the Magic Lantern files from the card! If you do, the camera will freeze at startup and you'll have to take the battery out.**

Uninstalling ML from one card
-------------------------------

Format that card from the camera and reboot. Your camera will load the original firmware when you use that card.

Uninstalling ML from the camera
-------------------------------

With a Magic Lantern card, launch the ``Firmware Update`` process and follow the instructions on-screen. You will have to hold the shutter button pressed half-way for 3 seconds in order to confirm your action.

Troubleshooting
===============

* Check if all doors are closed. The camera will not boot if any of the SD card or battery doors are open !
* If the camera does not boot (seems dead), **remove the battery and the card**. Then put the battery back and try to boot the camera without card. Then put a formatted card in the camera and try to boot '''without''' Magic Lantern. Only after you are sure the camera is OK, you can try to see what's wrong with Magic Lantern.
* **Again, NEVER let a prepared card without a working autoexec.bin on it, remove the battery immediatly during 5 seconds, switching off is not enough !!!**
* Look in the `issue tracker <https://bitbucket.org/hudson/magic-lantern/issues>`_ for similar problems; if you can't find the solution, create a new issue there.
