Magic Lantern 0.2 for Canon 550D, Firmware 1.0.9
================================================

Configuration file
------------------

The configuration file (``MAGIC.CFG``) lets you tweak various hidden settings
using a simple text editor (Notepad, gedit, vi...), and is also used
to save Magic Lantern configuration from the GUI menu.

Saving settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From the Magic Lantern menu, choose Debug -> Save config. 
Your config file will be overwritten with current Magic Lantern settings.
Comments from the file will be removed!

Hidden settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These settings can not be changed from the ML menu, so they are documented here::

    # if set to 1, disable the bootdisk flag. 
    # This does the same thing as Debug->Autoboot menu item.
    magic.disable_bootdiskf = 0

    # Draw a property value (here BodyID)
    debug.dump_prop = 0x1000006

    # Controls the refresh rate for zebra & friends 
    # (delay in ms between updates)
    zebra.delay = 1000

    # Delay between clearing the overlay in Clear Preview mode
    clear.preview.delay = 500

    # Stack focus step size and frame count
    focus.step = 100
    focus.count = 5

    # Limits allowed for qscale control. 
    # Since negative values are not allowed in config file, 
    # put the absolute values here. Qscale can have only negative values.
    h264.qscale.max.neg = 1
    h264.qscale.min.neg = 16
    
    # Cropmarks (you can cycle between them). Max 3 entries.
    crop.file.1 = B:/hd_ta.bmp
    crop.file.2 = B:/CineScop.bmp
    crop.file.3 = B:/fish8r.bmp

    # delay [ms] before starting the bracketing sequence
    brack.startdelay = 2000
    # delay [ms] between two consecutive shots in Bracketing mode
    brack.delay = 1000

    # button used for Magic Lantern menu
    # Press/unpress codes (hex)
    # 1c/1d = left
    # 1e/1f = up
    # 1a/1b = right
    # 20/21 = down
    # 4/5 = set
    # 7 = disp
    # 6 = menu
    # 8 = direct print (Q)
    # a = trash
    # Enter button value in decimal
    button.menu.on = 10
    button.menu.off = 10
