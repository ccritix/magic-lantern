Magic Lantern 0.2 for Canon 550D, Firmware 1.0.9
================================================

Configuration file
------------------

The configuration file (``MAGIC.CFG``) lets you tweak various hidden settings
using a simple text editor (Notepad, gedit, vi...), and is also used
to save Magic Lantern configuration from the GUI menu.

Saving settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From the Magic Lantern menu, choose Debug -> Save config. 
Your config file will be overwritten with current Magic Lantern settings.
Comments from the file will be removed!

Hidden settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These settings can not be changed from the ML menu, so they are documented here::

    # if set to 1, disable the bootdisk flag. 
    # This does the same thing as Debug->Autoboot menu item.
    # Only for advanced users!!!
    magic.disable_bootdiskf = 0

    # Delay between clearing the overlay in Clear Preview mode
    clear.preview.delay = 500

    # Stack focus step size and frame count
    focus.step = 100
    focus.count = 5

    # Limits allowed for qscale control. 
    # Since negative values are not allowed in config file, 
    # put the absolute values here. Qscale can have only negative values.
    h264.qscale.max.neg = 1
    h264.qscale.min.neg = 16
    
    # Threshold for audio trigger
    audio.release.level = 700
    
    # Delay between two sub-pics in hi-res silent pic mode
    silent.pic.sweepdelay = 350
