Magic Lantern 0.2 for Canon 550D, Firmware 1.0.9
================================================

.. _magic.cfg:

Configuration file
------------------

The configuration file (``MAGIC.CFG``) lets you tweak various hidden settings
using a simple text editor (Notepad, gedit, vi...), and is also used
to save Magic Lantern configuration from the GUI menu.

Saving settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Settings are saved automatically to ``MAGIC.CFG`` when you turn off the camera, or when you open the card door.

Settings are NOT saved when you open the battery door.

Hidden settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These settings can not be changed from the ML menu, so they are documented here::

    # if set to 1, disable the bootdisk flag. 
    # This does the same thing as Debug->Autoboot menu item.
    # Only for advanced users!!!
    magic.disable_bootdiskf = 0

    # Delay between clearing the overlay in Clear Preview mode
    clear.preview.delay = 500

    # Stack focus step size and frame count
    focus.step = 100
    focus.count = 5
    
    # Threshold for audio trigger
    audio.release.level = 700
    
    # Delay between two sub-pics in hi-res silent pic mode
    silent.pic.sweepdelay = 350
    
    # Zebra density: 0, 1 or 2
    zebra.density = 2

.. _iso.round.only:

::

    # Only select "round" ISO values in menu:
    # 100,200,400,800,1600,3200,6400,12800,25600,
    # 160,320,640,1250,2500.
    iso.round.only = 1

.. _set.on.halfshutter:

::

    # Emulate a SET press when you press the shutter half-way 
    # in photo dialogs and menu (so all dialogs like WB, self-timer, 
    # AF mode, flash setting etc. will behave like the ISO one)
    #
    # Set it on 0 to restore default firmware behavior
    set.on.halfshutter = 1

.. _quick.review.allow.zoom:

::

    # Allow zoom in Quick Review mode (only works when Image Review = Hold)
    # This works by faking a Play button press after you take a pic.
    # Side effect: some delay until you see the picture after you take it
    quick.review.allow.zoom = 1

.. _crop.movieonly:

::

    # If enabled, it will show cropmarks only in movie mode. 
    # Disable it to show cropmarks in photo mode too.
    crop.movieonly = 0
