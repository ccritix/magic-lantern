Magic Lantern 0.2 for Canon 550D, Firmware 1.0.9
================================================


Features
--------

* GUI menus: press the ERASE button to display them
* Bit rate control (QScale parameter) for the H.264 encoder
* Display time remaining during video recording
* Zebra stripes for overexposed / underexposed areas
* Simple intervalometer
* Remote release with the LCD sensor (i.e. put your hand near the LCD to take a pic) 
* AE bracketing (like on 5D2 ML) 
* Stack focus (see issues)
* Lens data computation 
* Onscreen audio meters
* Manual audio gain, selectable input source 
* Debug functions (event, property and debug logging, display CMOS temperature)

Known issues
------------

* For stack focus, you have first to go to Live View, then to Play mode, 
  make sure you have an image, then back to Live View.
* If you start the camera in LiveView mode, histogram and zebra may not show.
  If this happens, press MENU twice to get them.
* Sometimes the menu gets overwritten by Canon's drawing routines, or flickers. 
* After closing ML menu, screen may not redraw automatically 
  (half-press the shutter to trigger a redraw)
* Time remaining for video is meaningless if QScale control is enabled
  (maybe it should be calibrated with the real-time clock?)
* Rack focus does not seem to work.
* Playing with debug options may lead to strange behaviors of the
  camera (if it happens, restart it). 
* Boot menu entries may be dangerous => be careful with them!

Menu options
------------

Audio
~~~~~

.. image:: AudioMenu-550D.png
    :alt: thumb|right|Audio menu

Audio tweaks.

**AudioMeter: ON/OFF**
  Draw the audio meters or not.

**Output vol (dB)**
  Gain to external audio - currently this is the A/V jack (?) so not audible on just the camera

**Analog Gain (dB)**
  Gain applied to both inputs in the analog domain - intended as mic-type preamp, but always preferable to digital gain (unless you want different gain or run out of analog).

**L-Gain and R-Gain (dB)**
  Digital gain applied separately to the L and R channel.

**AGC: ON/OFF**
  Enable/disable Automatic Gain Control. Turn this to OFF to prevent hiss noise when recording silence.

**Filters: ON/OFF**
  Enable/disable digital audio filters (High Pass Filter, Low Pass Filter and stereo emphasis)

**Inp**
  Input source: Internal mic (dual mono); int L ext R; ext stereo; int L ext L+R (balanced). 

Video
~~~~~

.. image:: VideoMenu-550D.png
    :alt: thumb|right|Video menu


Video overlays: histogram, zebras, cropmarks, spotmeter.

**Global Draw: ON/OFF**
  Enable/disable drawing extra graphics elements 
  (zebra, cropmarks, histogram, spotmeter, audio meters)

**Histogram: ON/OFF**
  Show a histogram for the luma (Y) channel of the LiveView image. Colorspace is YUV.

**Zebras: ON/OFF**
  Enable/disable zebra stripes, which indicate overexposed or underexposed areas.

**ZebraThrLO, ZebraThrHI**
  Thresholds for underexposure and overexposure. 
  Brightness values are between 0 and 255.

**CropM**
  Enable/disable cropmarks. 
  Todo: cycle to all available cropmarks. For now, select the cropmark from the config file, 
  option "crop.file". See [[Cropmarks]].

**ClrPreview: ON/OFF**
  When shutter is half-pressed or DOF-preview is enabled, this clears 
  all the overlays from the Live View display after 1 second. 
  It allows you to compose the picture without any extra distractions. 
  This works best when autofocus is assigned to the * button (from Custom Functions).

**Spotmeter: ON/OFF/Hidden**
  Measure brightness in the center of the frame, and display it as a percentage.
  Indicator is at the bottom on the screen, centered horizontally. It displays 
  a small marker in the center of the screen. If the current cropmark already includes
  a center marker, use the Hidden option.

Shoot
~~~~~

.. image:: ShootMenu-550D.png
    :alt: thumb|right|Shoot menu

Functions for stills shooting.

**IntervalTime**
  Time delay for intervalometer, in seconds.

**Intervalometer: ON/OFF**
  Start/stop intervalometer. 

**LCD RemoteShot: ON/OFF**
  Start/stop shutter release with the LCD sensor. To take a picture, 
  put your hand near the LCD sensor. 

  This is useful for avoiding camera shake without extra $$$
  
  To use it, select one of P,S,A,M modes, turn OFF Live View, 
  and make sure "LCD auto off" is enabled (in the Canon menu, wrench 1).

You can also stop the intervalometer and remote shooting mode
by pressing PLAY or MENU.

Brack
~~~~~

.. image:: BrackMenu-550D.png
    :alt: thumb|right|Bracketing menu

AE bracketing.

**Test bracket**
  Take a few pictures with the selected settings.

**AE count**
  Number of pictures to take.

**AE step**
  Number of AE steps between two shots.
  
  How big is an AE step? 
  
  This feature is still buggy, and seems to work only in AV mode.

Focus
~~~~~

See the description from the `5D2 ML User Guide <http://magiclantern.wikia.com/wiki/Magic_Lantern_0.1.6_User_Manual#Focus_menu>`_.

See also [[Focus distance]].

Debug
~~~~~

.. image:: DebugMenu-550D.png
    :alt: thumb|right|Debug menu

**QScale**
  Controls the H.264 QScale parameter, which affects video bitrate. 
  Lower values mean higher bitrates. OFF should disable QScale control.
  
  See [[Bit rate]] wiki page for details.
  
  Default range is [-1 ... -16]. This can be changed from config file, 
  but qscale is restricted to negative values only, 
  due to limitations in config file parser.
  
  QScale setting is not saved; it is applied only when you select this option
  from menu. It may be overwritten by camera firmware when changing video modes.
  When the camera starts, it is OFF.

**Save config**
  Save current settings to MAGIC.CFG.

**CMOS temp**
  Temperature of the CMOS sensor, in raw units.

**Draw palette**
  Tests the 8-bit bitmap palette, which is used for video overlays. See [[VRAM]].

**Screenshot (10 s)**
  Print screen after 10 seconds (it saves a BMP file). 
  Only the bitmap overlays are included in the screenshot (i.e. no live view image).

**Dump dmlog**
  Saves a log which contains DebugMsg output.
  See [[Debugging Magic Lantern]] wiki page.

**Toggle draw_prop**
  Display property changes in real-time.
  See [[Properties]].

**Toggle draw_event**
  Display GUI events in real-time, and also inhibits most of them.
  See [[GUI_Events/550D]].

Some items from this menu may not be available in release builds, 
because they are potentially dangerous.

Boot
~~~~

.. image:: BootMenu-550D.png
    :alt: thumb|right|Boot menu

Settings related to the Magic Lantern boot process.

**Write MBR**
  ??? partition a card with MBR (aka "erase it"?). MBR as in "Master boot record"?

**Autoboot: ON/OFF**
  Make the card bootable?!

**Powersave**
  Disable the powersave so that the LiveView never shuts off?

  WARNING -- this can cause problems with your sensor!

  '''DO NOT LEAVE THE CAMERA ON CONTINUOUSLY.'''

Some items from this menu may not be available in release builds,
