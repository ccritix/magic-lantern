Important notes
---------------

* If you have a bootable SD card and have the ``BOOTDISK`` flag set in the camera (which the installer does), and you do not have an ``AUTOEXEC.BIN`` file on the card the camera **WILL NOT BOOT**! It will hang and not wake up until the battery is removed.

* If you encounter a "locked up" camera, **quickly remove the battery**.

* When in doubt, remove the battery and reboot.

* **And, remember that this software can damage or destroy your camera.**

Known issues
------------

* First second of recorded audio may be very loud.
* Sometimes, rack and stack focus simply refuse to work, and you need to restart your camera.
* SD monitors are not completely supported (magic zoom and RGB tools will not work).
* Magic Lantern has no audio controls on 600D/T3i. You can disable AGC from Canon menus though.

Common terms
------------

Movie mode
~~~~~~~~~~

Most cameras have a dedicated movie mode on the mode dial. In this case, it's obvious what movie mode is.

However, the following cameras do not have a dedicated movie mode. For these cameras, Magic Lantern considers the following configurations as "movie mode":

* For Canon 5D Mark II: in LiveView, with movie recording enabled AND LiveView display set to Movie. Tip: you can change LiveView display type from Expo menu.
* For Canon 50D: in LiveView, with movie recording enabled from ML menu.

When movie mode is active, Magic Lantern will show a ``Mv`` symbol on the bottom info bar.

The ``Q`` button
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most cameras have a button labeled as ``[Q]``. A few cameras don't, so you will have to use some other button:

* 5D Mark II: press the ``Picture Style`` button.
* 50D: press the ``FUNC`` button.
* 500D: press the LiveView button.


Key shortcuts
-------------

PLAY mode shortcuts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``Q`` (550D), ``UNLOCK`` (60D), ``DISP`` (600D), ``LV`` (500D), ``FUNC`` (50D) or ``Picture Style`` (5D Mark II): show exposure tools (zebra, false color, histogram, waveform, spotmeter) and cropmarks (as configured from `LiveV`_ menu).
* ``LV``: create a transparent overlay from current image (when `Ghost Image`_ is active). You can use it for panoramas or for repeating shots.
* ``SET`` + ``Main Dial (Scrollwheel)`` in ``PLAY`` mode: see `SET+MainDial`_.

Arrow key shortcuts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Arrow keys can be used to quickly adjust the following settings:

* Audio gains and input source;
* ISO (in intermediate steps) and Kelvin WB (push-button WB also available);
* Shutter and aperture, in finer steps;
* LCD backlight, saturation and display gain.

You can select what functions you need from Tweaks menu.

To enable the shortcut menu, press the following key:

Audio
~~~~~

.. figure:: AudioMenu-550D.png
    :alt: Audio menu
    :align: center
    :width: 5cm

Manual audio controls.

**This menu is not available on Canon 600D / T3i.**

The 600D/T3i already has manual audio control, but right now it's not possible to change audio settings
from Magic Lantern. You can only use audio meters during recording.

.. _audio meters:

Audio Meters
````````````

Display the input audio level, from -40dB to 0dB; meters become yellow at -12 dB and red at -3 dB.

Audio meters are only displayed in movie mode.

.. _manual audio controls:

Analog Gain (dB)
````````````````
{{ vimeo>18507408?250x140|Audio tests by Ryan SauvÃ©}}

Gain applied to both inputs in the analog domain. If you use an external preamp, set this parameter as low as possible; otherwise, set it as high as possible without clipping (audio meters should be green).

L-DigitalGain and R-DigitalGain (dB)
````````````````````````````````````

Digital gain applied to left and right channel. Recommended setting: 0.

.. _disable AGC:

AGC
```

{{ vimeo>5903379?250x140|Audio_Conclusions}}

Enable/disable Automatic Gain Control. AGC is applied only in digital domain (i.e. it overrides digital gains, but you can still adjust analog gain). 
  
Recommended setting: OFF.

.. _input source:

Input source
````````````

Audio input source for recording: 
  
* **internal mic**
* **L:int R:ext**
* **external stereo**
* **L:int R:balanced** (internal mic on Left, external mic on Right from both external pins as balanced audio)
* **Auto int/ext**: camera detects if a mic is plugged in. Int is dual mono, ext is stereo.

.. _balanced:

.. figure:: XLRtoBalancedCable.jpg
    :alt: XLR microphone to Balanced input pinouts
    :align: center
    :width: 8cm

"Balanced audio allows for very long cable runs without interference. Usually balanced mics have three pin XLR connectors and it is very easy to out together an XLR to Canon mic input cable. Balanced allows us to use such pro mics with our little Canons and this is a very welcome surprise for audio guys." `(source) <http://www.cinema5d.com/viewtopic.php?f=39&t=24384&st=0&sk=t&sd=a&start=330#p164691>`_

Wind Filter
```````````

Digital high-pass filter. See {{:ak4646.pdf|AK4646 datasheet}} p.34.

Mic Power
`````````

This is required for internal mic and certain types of external mics, but it reduces input impedance. See {{:ak4646.pdf|AK4646 datasheet}} p.31 and the `Mic power control <http://groups.google.com/group/ml-devel/browse_thread/thread/516d22e75dcb9357>`_ thread.

* ``ON``: input impedance is 2 kOhm
* ``OFF``: input impedance is 30 kOhm
  
This setting is always ``ON`` when input source is either ``internal mic`` or ``L:int R:ext``.

.. _audio monitoring:

Headphone Monitoring
````````````````````
  
{{ vimeo>21672001?250x140| Audio monitoring tutorial}}
  
Audio monitoring with headphones, via USB port.
  
**Disable this setting if you are using a SD monitor!**

**This feature is not available on 600D/T3i.**

To use audio monitoring, you need a special cable:
  
* your Canon USB - RCA cable with `a RCA - 3.5mm jack adapter <http://amzn.to/ml-audiomon-rca35>`_
* `a dedicated cable from Sescom <http://www.sescom.com/product.asp?item=DSLR-550D-HOCF>`_
* or you may solder it yourself (you will have to cut the USB-RCA cable). 
  
Warning: mobile phone cables **will not work**; even if the connector looks similar, it's not identical. You must use `the original cable which came with your camera <http://amzn.to/canon-usb-rca>`_.
  
For details, see `Audio monitoring HOWTO on Vimeo group <http://vimeo.com/groups/magiclantern/forumthread:237296>`_.

Output volume (dB)
``````````````````

Digital output gain for audio monitoring. It does not have any effect on the internal camera speaker.

For best results, you should a pair of low impedance headphones, for example `Audio Technica ATH-M50 (38 ohms) <http://amzn.to/ml-athm50>`_.
With high-impedance headphones, you may have to use a headphone amplifier like `FiiO E5 <http://amzn.to/fiio-e5>`_.
  

LiveV
~~~~~

.. figure:: LiveVMenu-550D.png
    :align: center
    :width: 5cm

LiveView overlays: histogram, zebras, cropmarks, spotmeter, focus peaking, false color...

.. _Global Draw:

Global Draw
```````````

Enable/disable drawing extra graphics elements 
(zebra, cropmarks, histogram, waveform, false color, spotmeter, audio meters, ML shooting info...).

Tip: use this setting to quickly turn them off.

.. _histogram:
.. _waveform:

Histogram and Waveform
``````````````````````

{{ vimeo>33179488?250x140|Using The Video Histogram To Keep Detail in the Highlights}}

These exposure tools will show the distribution of image brightness levels.
  
.. figure:: Histogram-and-waveform.png
    :align: center
    :height: 2cm

To learn how to read these graphs, see `Understanding Histograms <http://www.luminous-landscape.com/tutorials/understanding-series/understanding-histograms.shtml>`_ and `Final Cut Waveform Monitor <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXMvFk146R0>`_.

Vectorscope
```````````

This tool shows the color distribution with an U-V plot. Useful for color grading.

To learn how to read it, see `Introducing Color Scopes: The Vectorscope <http://www.kdenlive.org/users/granjow/introducing-color-scopes-vectorscope>`_.

.. _zebras:

Zebras
``````

.. figure:: Zebras.jpg
    :align: center
    :height: 2cm

Enable/disable zebra stripes, which indicate overexposed or underexposed areas.
  
Color spaces:
    
* ``Luma``: zebras are computed from Y channel only.
* ``RGB``: check overexposure for each RGB channel. Clipped channels are displayed in the opposite color (i.e. clipped red shown as cyan, underexposed as white and so on). For RAW RGB zebras, use the UniWB method (see `Histogram`_ for details).
  
You may adjust thresholds for underexposure and overexposure.
  
Note: when using the Technicolor CineStyle picture style, luma will have values between 16 and 255; therefore, you will have to set the underexposure threshold to 16 or greater.

.. _false color:

False color
```````````

This is a tool for evaluating the exposure. It shows different luma (Y) levels using a color map.
You may select one of the following color maps:

.. figure:: falsecolor.png
    :align: center
    :width: 13cm

Tips:
  
* you may configure a `display preset`_ with False Color and toggle it with a single button press.
* you may also use false colors to highlight 50% and 70% brightness levels, or to reveal color banding, or to check for uniform green screen lighting.
  
.. _Cropmark:

Cropmarks
`````````
 
Cropmarks or custom grids for framing and composition.

.. figure:: Cropmarks550D.png
    :align: center
    :width: 12cm
  
Notes:
    
* If you use custom cropmarks, place them in ``CROPMKS`` folder on your SD card and give them short 8.3 names. You can place at most 9 cropmarks on the card.
* Get more cropmarks `from the ML cropmark repository <http://www.sawomedia.de/magiclantern/cropmarks/>`_ or draw your own (see [[Cropmarks]]).

{{ vimeo>25182804?250x140|Cropmarks Tutorial}}
  
.. _ghost image:

Ghost image
```````````

Shows a transparent overlay which can be created from any image in Play mode.
  
Usage:
  
* To select the image, go to Play mode and press the ``LiveView`` button.
* Move the ghost image in LiveView with arrow keys; center or hide it with ``SET`` or joystick press.

Defishing
`````````

Preview the rectified (defished) image from `Samyang 8mm fisheye lens <http://amzn.to/ml-samyang-8mm>`_, using rectilinear projection.
  
Tip: in PLAY mode it's colored.
  
Defishing is computed with a LUT, from LiveView image buffer. It is possible to create LUT files for any other lens or projection by defishing ``vram/xy.png`` with your favorite defishing software, and then running ``vram/defish-lut.m`` to get the LUT file. All the required files are found in the ML source tree. Project files (``*.PTO``) for nona (hugin) are provided for both rectilinear and Panini projections.
  
.. _spotmeter:

Spotmeter
`````````

Measure brightness from a small spot in the frame.
  
Possible measurement units:
  
* Percent (0..100%)
* Raw 8-bit levels (0..255)
* IRE -1..101 (formula used by AJ, which maps 0-255 brightness levels to approx. -1..101 IRE)
* IRE 0..108 (formula proposed by Piers, which maps 16-235 brightness levels to 7.5-100 IRE)
* RGB (displays `HTML-like color codes <http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_colors.asp>`_)
  
.. _Display:
.. _Clean LiveView display:

Clear Overlays
``````````````
 
Clear bitmap overlays from LiveView display.
 
* ``HalfShutter``: Hold the shutter half-pressed, or the ``*`` button, or DOF preview for around 1 second
  to clear all the overlays from the Live View display (audio, zebra, crops, shutter speeds...).
  
  Tip: assign autofocus to ``*`` button (from Custom Functions, set ``Shutter/AE lock button`` = ``AE lock/AF``).
  
* ``WhenIdle``: In this mode, all the overlays are erased from the screen (100% clean display) when the camera is idle (i.e. you don't press any buttons).

* ``Always``: In this mode, all the overlays are erased from the screen; you will have to change shooting settings blindly. You can still use the menus.
  
  Tip: this feature may be useful with [[External Recorders]], since it removes the focus box and other graphics from the display.

.. _focus peaking:

Focus Peak
``````````
  
{{ vimeo>18782586?250x140|Focus Peaking demo}}

Focus assist function. High-contrast lines will be marked by blinking dots showing which part of the image is in focus.
  
Methods:
  
* ``D1xy``: computes first image derivative on X and Y and takes the max value. May work better in low light or on noisy sensors.
* ``D2xy``: approximates second image derivative with a 3x3 Laplacian kernel. May be more accurate in good light.

Other parameters:
  
* ``Threshold``: how many pixels are considered in focus (percentage).
* ``Color``: either fixed color, or a color coding according to focus intensity.
* ``Grayscale img``: if enabled, LiveView will displayed as grayscale (but still recorded as color).
  
To see how it works, `check this article from Luminous Landscape <http://www.luminous-landscape.com/forum/index.php?topic=56246.0>`_.

.. _magic zoom:
.. _zoom while recording:

Magic Zoom
``````````

{{ vimeo>29053985?250x140|Magic Zoom demo}}

Displays a zoom box for focus assist. Can be used while recording.
  
Trigger modes (not all modes are available on all cameras):
  
* ``HalfShutter``: triggered when you press the shutter button halfway.
* ``Focus Ring``: triggered by turning the focus ring.
* ``Zoom.REC``: triggered by pressing ``Zoom In`` button while recording. If your camera has a LCD sensor, you may also cover it and press ``Zoom In``.
* ``FocusR+HalfS``: triggered by turning the focus ring, or by pressing shutter halfway.
* ``Focus+ZREC``: triggered by turning the focus ring, or by pressing ``Zoom In`` while recording.
* ``Zoom In (*)``: triggered by ``Zoom In`` button (overrides Canon's default zoom modes). To bypass magic zoom, press both zoom buttons at the same time or cover the LCD sensor.
* ``Always On``: no trigger key needed. You can use both Canon's 5x/10x zoom and Magic Zoom.

When ML believes you have achieved perfect focus, Magic Zoom will display a focus confirmation (customizable):

* ``Green Bars`` 
* ``Split Screen``: when the image is out of focus, the zoom box looks like a split focusing screen from old film cameras. 
* ``Split Screen with ZeroCross``: will reverse the split direction whenever you achieve perfect focus.

Other parameters: size, position, magnification.
  
Notes:
  
* `Zebras`_, `focus peaking`_ and `false color`_ are disabled automatically when the zoom overlay is active.
* Focus triggering **only** works with lenses that report [[Focus distance]], or when you use `follow focus`_ / `rack focus`_.
* In some modes, half-pressing the shutter may temporarily hide the zoom overlay.

Movie
~~~~~

.. figure:: MovieMenu-550D.png
    :align: center
    :width: 5cm

Functions specific to movie mode.

.. _Bitrate control:
.. _bitrate:

Bit Rate
````````

Controls H.264 bitrate used for video recording.
  
Possible modes:
  
* ``CBR``: constant bitrate. You specify a factor for multiplying default video bitrate, between 0.1x and 3x. CBR 1x is the firmware default setting.
* ``QScale``: constant quality, variable bitrate (VBR). Available values: -16 ... +16. Lower numbers mean higher bitrates.
* ``Firmware default``: completely disable bitrate control.
    
Notes:
 
* Increasing the bitrate **may cause recording to stop**. You need a fast card.
* CBR actually works by adjusting QScale on the fly; the instant value is displayed near the recording dot.
* In QScale mode, bitrate is completely out of control (don't use it!).
* In CBR mode, QScale will not go outside [-16...+16]. When QScale reaches the extreme values (-16 or +16), bitrate **will be different** than your CBR setting. Watch the bitrate indicators. This is not a bug, please do not report it.
* You can push the bitrate higher if you record without sound, then use `Audio RemoteShot`_ to sync the video with an external audio track.
* You can't change this setting during recording.
* If buffer usage gets too high, ML will pause all CPU-intensive graphics. Change the ``BuffWarnLevel`` setting to customize this.

.. _time remaining display:

Time Indicator
``````````````

When recording a movie, ML will display a small time counter in the upper right corner, 
which can be:

* ``Elapsed``: duration of the current clip
* ``Remain.Card``: estimated amount of recording time remaining on the card.
* ``Remain.4GB``:  estimated amount of recording time until reaching 4GB (or until filling the card, whichever comes first).

Unlike Canon's timer which assumes constant bitrate, ML timer assumes variable bitrate and works even if QScale is enabled.
However, due to variations in bitrate, the estimated value will fluctuate a lot, and **this is normal**.

.. _auto-restart:
.. _movie restart:

Movie Restart
`````````````

While this setting is on, movie recording will restart automatically, unless you stop it. There will be a few seconds skipped during restarting.

.. _movie logging:

Movie Logging
`````````````

If this setting is ``ON``, Magic Lantern will write out a metadata file for the each movie to ``MVI_1234.LOG`` (numbered after the movie). The log file contains lens and exposure info, as well as a timestamp every time any of the parameters is changed during recording. 
  
Log files are placed in the same folder as the movies: ``DCIM/100CANON/``, ``101CANON`` etc.
  
Tip: you can rename ``LOG`` files to ``CSV`` and import them in MS Excel.

.. _change movie position:

MovieModeRemap
``````````````

Changes movie position on the mode dial. You can swap movie mode with either ``A-DEP``, ``CA`` or ``C``.
  
Shortcut key: press ISO and then press LV.
  
.. _Movie REC key:

Movie REC key
`````````````

This option enables you to start/stop movie recording by half-pressing the shutter button.

Tip: with this, you can use a wired remote to start/stop recording.

Shutter Lock
````````````

This option locks the shutter value in movie mode (you will be able to change it only from ML menu).

REC/STBY notify
```````````````

Custom notifications for recording or standby:
  
* Red Crossout (highly recommended if you forget to press record)
* Message (it shows ``STBY`` or ``REC``)
* Beeps (it will beep when recording starts or stops)
* Blue LED (obvious if your camera has it)

.. _DigitalZoom Shortcut:

DigitalZoom Shortcut (600D)
```````````````````````````

On 600D/T3i, this lets you customize the behavior of ``DISP`` + ``Zoom In / Zoom Out`` shortcut key in movie mode:

* ``1x,3x`` : toggle between 1x and 3x digital zoom modes (FullHD)
* ``3x...10x``: default Canon setting (change digital zoom value between 3x and 10x).
  
Note: by default, Magic Lantern disables digital zoom values greater than 3x in order to avoid image quality degradation.

Force LiveView
``````````````

Force LiveView in Movie mode (bypass the dialog saying *Press LV button to activate movie shooting*).
  
* Always: force LiveView even if you use an unchipped lens, or no lens at all. Be careful, you may get dust on the sensor while changing lenses.
* Start & CPU lenses: it will force LiveView at startup, regardless of the lens used. After this, it will only bypass the dialog when a chipped lens is attached (i.e. it will enter LiveView as soon as you attach a chipped lens).

Movie Record (50D)
``````````````````
  
Enable movie recording on 50D (1920x1080, 30fps, without sound). To start recording, go to LiveView (P/Tv/Av/M) and press SET.
  
**WARNING**
  
Canon 50D was **NOT** designed to record movies. Keep in mind:
  
* This feature was not thoroughly tested by Canon and may be unstable (even if you record without ML).
* Always disable movie recording when you don't use it.
* Battery will drain quickly when recording; also, the camera may overheat.
  
Limitations:
  
* The camera will not record sound. You can use an external recorder (for example, `Zoom H1, H2 or H4n <http://amzn.to/zoom-h>`_) and sync the sound in post with a clapperboard.
* You can't play back movies in the camera.
  
This setting remains active even if you start the camera with standard firmware (until you clear your settings).

Exposure Lock (50D)
```````````````````

Locks the exposure in movie mode. You can also use the ``*`` button (you don't have to hold it pressed).

Shutter Button (50D)
````````````````````

* ``Leave unchanged``: obvious :)
* ``Block during REC``: blocks the shutter and related (AF, ``*``) buttons while recording. In 50D, taking pictures while recording would result in ERR99; with this option, you can avoid taking pictures while recording by mistake. Side effect: this will disable image stabilization during recording.
* ``Hold during REC (IS)``: ML will keep the shutter button pressed half-way during recording, which will enable image stabilization (IS). Side effect: you need to press the shutter button half way to turn IS off before the camera will let you stop recording.

.. _FPS override:
.. _slit-scan pictures:

FPS override
````````````

This setting alters FPS for all video modes. Only undercranking works well.

FPS is changed by altering two timer values (let's call them Timer A and Timer B). Increasing any of these values results in lower FPS. Aside from FPS, changing these timers may alter shutter speed and rolling shutter.

Options:
  
* Desired FPS: choose a value from 0.2 fps to 65 fps. If the desired value is not possible, ML will choose the closest safe option (look at 'Actual FPS' below).
  
* Optimize for: 
    
  * Low FPS, 360d: use this option for recording timelapse with shutter speed set to 1/fps (360 degrees); at high FPS values, you may be able to use other shutter speed values.
  * Exact FPS: try to achieve an exact FPS value, such as 24.000 or 30.000 or 12.500. If more solutions are found, ML will choose the one with lowest jello effect.
  * LowJello, 180d: minimize the jello effect (caused by rolling shutter), while allowing you to expose at 180 degrees (0.5/fps) if possible.
  * High Jello: maximize the jello effect and enable fast shutter speeds. You can use this mode for recording slit-scan frames (distorted images `like these <http://people.rit.edu/andpph/text-slit-scan.html>`_, which use the extreme jello effect in creative ways).

* Shutter range: displays the available shutter speed range with current settings. When you use FPS override, Canon menu will still display 1/30 ... 1/4000, but the actual shutter speed will be different; read it from ML displays. You can alter shutter speed range by changing the ratio between the two timer values (decreasing timer B will result in faster shutter speeds available).
 
* Timer A: displays the value of timer A and lets you fine-tune it. ML will re-adjust timer B to match your FPS choice.
  
* Timer B: displays the value of timer B and lets you fine-tune it. ML will not re-adjust timer A, so this option will let you fine-tune the exact FPS value.
 
* TG Frequency: displays the crystal oscillator frequency of the FPS circuit driver (read-only, depends on your camera).
  
* Actual FPS: this displays the current FPS, computed as TG_FREQ / timerA / timerB (read-only).
  
* Sound Record: by default, ML will disable sound recording when FPS override is enabled; otherwise, audio will go out of sync and recording will stop. Only enable sound if you know what you are doing.

Notes and tips:  

* This function will **not** change the frame rate from the video header; the video will playback at the setting from Canon menu.

* Recommended usage: set FPS to a very low value (for example, 3fps) to record a timelapse.

* To get 180-degree shutter speed at very low FPS, simply discard half of the frames in post.

* If 0.2 FPS is not enough, use `Frame Merger <http://bit.ly/frame-merger>`_ (a VirtualDub plugin).

* Exact frame rate may be "rounded" to be an exact multiple of PAL/NTSC frame rates.
      
  * PAL modes: 25p/50p. Rounded frame rates: 33.333fps, 12.5fps, 11.111fps and so on.
  * NTSC modes: 30p/60p/24p. Rounded frame rates: 29.97fps, 23.976fps, 11.988fps and so on.

* For fine-tuning and calibrating custom frame rates, use `EOSTimerGen <http://bit.ly/EOSTimerGen>`_.

* In ``M`` mode, this function does shutter and/or ISO bracketing. In the other modes it does exposure compensation bracketing.

* To start bracketing, take the first picture and ML will continue the sequence.

* To preview HDR images in camera, set `SET+MainDial`_: ExposureFusion from `Play`_ menu, 
  then go to playback mode, hold ``SET`` and turn the main dial (wheel).
  
* For each HDR picture set, Magic Lantern also writes a bash script for stacking the exposures
  with `enfuse <http://wiki.panotools.org/Enfuse>`_ (version 4.x). More info: `Exposure Fusion: What is it? How does it Compare to HDR? How Do I Do It? <http://www.digital-photography-school.com/exposure-fusion-what-is-it-how-does-it-compare-to-hdr-how-do-i-do-it>`_.

[[http://www.flickr.com/photos/jackschroeder/6022255031/in/pool-1676739@N21|{{ Stars-Intervalometer.jpg?200}}]]

{{ vimeo>19854305?250x140}}

Take pictures or movies at fixed intervals.

You can stop the intervalometer by rotating the mode dial, by pressing ``MENU`` or ``PLAY``, or by turning off the camera.

Settings:

* Duration between two shots.
* Start delay (up to 8 hours).
* Stop after X pictures.
* In movie mode only: duration of a movie clip.

Tips:
  
* To avoid flicker, shoot in **manual** mode, use **manual white balance**, **avoid short exposure** times and **use a manual lens** (if you use an EF lens, lock the aperture and **unscrew** it).
* To make a timelapse without increasing shutter count, do not use the intervalometer; instead, set `FPS override`_ to a very low value (for example, 3fps) and start recording.
* When using the intervalometer in LiveView with "noisy" mode, your shutter will wear twice as fast than outside LiveView.
* If the intervalometer can't be stopped (it may happen in ``crazy`` mode), turn the camera off or open the card door.

Power Saving:
  
* When not in LiveView, press ``DISP`` or ``INFO`` to turn the display off.
* In LiveView, ML will turn the display and the sensor off during idle times if you enable this option from ``Powersave`` menu.
* While the intervalometer is running, the card led will blink once per second to let you know it's alive and kicking.

.. _bulb ramping:

Bulb/Focus Ramping
``````````````````

{{ vimeo>29923391?250x140}}

Bulb Ramping allows the capture of a timelapse that gradually changes
exposure, compensating for the transition from day to night. 

This option will adjust shutter and ISO automatically, using the 180 degree rule.

**Quick start:**
  
**1.** Take a picture of your scene. You will use it to say: "I want my timelapse to be exposed like this picture".

**2.** Enable Bulb Ramping and Intervalometer.

**3.** Leave the camera still while ML runs a calibration step:
  
- Make sure you have a static and well-lit scene (any static scene which does not require long exposure should be fine).
- After calibration, you should get a nice S-curve on the screen.
    
**4.** Now you will have to say what tone range to meter for (i.e. highlights, midtones...). Follow the wizard:
  
- Use arrow keys to select your reference picture (which you just took).
- Use the main dial to select the tone range to meter for. You can't perfectly match two images just by varying one parameter (exposure), so you have to choose what's important for you in this picture.
- For lowest flicker, meter for midtones (choose the 50th percentile, i.e. median). Leave some headroom for highlights (underexpose a bit).
- If highlights are important, meter for them (choose 80th percentile for example). You will get more flicker; shoot RAW to remove it easier in post.
- The algorithm works best when brightness is close to 50% (try not to choose extreme values for it).
- When you are ready to start, press ``SET``.
    
**5.** Sit back and relax :)
  
Limits:
  
* ISO is chosen between 100 and maximum auto ISO value from Canon menu.
* Shutter speed is chosen between 1/1000 (lower limit) and the delay between two shots minus two seconds (upper limit). Example: for 10-second intervals, shutter speed will be between 1/1000 and 8 seconds).
* Aperture is fixed (you can change it manually).
 
Tips: 
  
* Don't adjust ISO and shutter before the timelapse, they are fully automatic.
* Use a `ND filter <http://amzn.to/ml-nd-filter>`_ to reduce flicker during daylight.
* Reduce flicker in post. You may try VirtualDub with MSU Deflicker plugin (free, works with Windows and Wine). See also `Timelapse workflow using free software tutorial <http://vimeo.com/groups/magiclantern/videos/19854305>`_.
* The delay between two shots affects how ISO and shutter are chosen, according to 180 degree rule:
  
  - For example, let's say you set "Take pics every 40 seconds"
  - ML will try to set the shutter speed between 90 and 270 degrees. In our example, it will be chosen between 10 and 30 seconds if the light conditions allow it.
  - If the scene is too bright or too dark, shutter will be chosen between 1/1000 (at ISO 100) and (*d* - 2) seconds (at max auto ISO, up to 6400), where *d* is the delay between two shots.

Techincal notes:
    
* Exposure is adjusted using a condition like this (for example): *70% of pixels should be below 50% brightness*.
* Exposure for every shot is computed from previous shot only (camera will go to Play mode for one second to compute the exposure from the `histogram`_).
* ISO is chosen using the 180 degree rule, so the resulting shutter speed stays between 90 and 270 degrees (that is, between 1/4 and 3/4 of the delay between two shots).
* Only full-stop ISOs (100, 200, 400 etc) are used, for best dynamic range.
* Shutter speed can be adjusted with a resolution of 10ms.
* Frames with fast shutter speeds (less than 1 second in Rebel cameras, less 0.1 seconds in 60D) are taken in Manual mode. You will get flicker.
* It can go from 1/8000s @ ISO 100 (daylight) to several minutes of exposure time @ ISO 6400 (complete darkness).
* Exposure algorithm is a feedback controller designed with pole placement - the closed loop response will have two real poles placed at the smoothing factor value.
* If the lighting changes suddenly a few stops between two shots, the algorithm should recover completely after 2 or 3 shots.
  
.. _bulb timer:

Bulb Timer
``````````

[[http://www.flickr.com/photos/74588953@N00/6082369585/in/pool-1676739@N21|{{ BulbTimer-Intervalometer-60x60s-M31-Brent.jpg?200}}]]
[[http://www.flickr.com/photos/ajaykrishnan/5900337137|{{ LongExp.jpg?200}}]]

Very long exposures with Bulb mode and ML timer. This feature is useful for night shots and astrophotography.
  
Bulb timer is started by half-shutter press, or by remote triggers / intervalometer.
  
Tip: you can cancel the exposure earlier by half-pressing the shutter button.

.. _remote triggers:
.. _LCD face sensor:
.. _LCDsensor Remote:
.. _LCD Remote:

LCDsensor Remote
````````````````

Start/stop remote shutter release mode with the LCD sensor. 
  
* â¨ **Near**: To take a picture, put your hand near the LCD sensor.
* â¨ **Away**: Picture is taken when you get your hand away from the sensor. You may combine this setting with `Mirror Lockup`_.
* ã° **Wave**: Picture is taken after you wave your hand 3 times near the sensor. You can leave it on without interfering (too much) with normal shooting.

This feature is useful for avoiding camera shake.
  
In Movie mode, the ``Wave`` ã° setting is able to start and stop recording movies. The other modes can only start recording (because it's too easy to stop recording by mistake).

While recording, the ``Near`` and ``Away`` modes can trigger the `rack focus`_ operation.
  
.. _audio trigger:
.. _audio RemoteShot:

Audio RemoteShot
````````````````

Start/stop remote audio trigger. To take a picture (or start recording a movie), make some loud noise, for example, clap your hands or pop a balloon.
  
Tip: with the audio trigger you can sync a video *recorded without sound* with an *external audio track* `(see this topic) <http://groups.google.com/group/ml-devel/browse_thread/thread/14522b5d65a43cbf/e472d79ab8c4e57b?show_docid=e472d79ab8c4e57b>`_

Be careful: this may trigger the shutter from the sounds made by camera (like focus beep or noise from operating the buttons).


Motion Detect
`````````````

[[http://johnnyionix.blogspot.com/2011/05/usando-motion-detect-magic-lantern-para.html|{{ MotionDetection-Bird.jpg?200}}]]
[[http://groups.google.com/group/ml-devel/browse_thread/thread/850497aa7e732a68|{{ MotionDetection-Lightning-6-4-2011-3.jpg?200}}]]

Motion detection in LiveView.

Trigger modes:
    
* ``Exposure change``: it only reacts to brightness changes. Detects large moving subjects which cause significant change in exposure.
* ``Frame difference``: it computes the difference between last two frames A and B (luma channel only); detects smaller movements which do not change exposure. Trigger condition is:
  
.. raw:: latex
  
  $$ \sum_{i,j}{ |A_{ij} - B_{ij}| } > level $$
   
Detection time is somewhere between 200 and 300 ms according to `DataGhost's speed test <http://dataghost.com/chdk/md_meter.html>`_; it's faster with silent pictures.

.. _silent pictures:
.. _Silent Picture:

Silent Pictures
```````````````

{{ vimeo>18835420?250x140}}

This feature is reserved to very advanced users. It can take pictures in LiveView mode without moving the mirror. When enabled, it saves uncompressed YUV422 frames from the LiveView image buffer when you press the shutter halfway.
  
* Make sure you don't have autofocus assigned to half-shutter press (put it on ``*`` or turn it off)
  
Modes:
  
* ``Silent Picture``: simple, low-resolution. Image resolution is usually around 1 or 2 MPix, and depends on the current mode (zoom or not, recording or not, and movie resolution). For almost-FullHD resolution (1720x974), choose ``FullHD`` to record a dummy movie.
* ``Silent Pic Hi-Res``: emulates high-resolution by taking a matrix of small silent pics, in zoom ``x5`` mode. You need to have the camera on a tripod and the subject should be static (a picture is taken in a few seconds). Could be useful for `focus stacking`_ or for timelapse without increasing shutter count.
  
Silent picture setting is applied to `intervalometer`_ and `remote triggers`_. It will also go to LiveView when you press the shutter half-way. Therefore, you should only enable this setting when you actually use it.
  
Images are saved in ``DCIM/1xxCANON/`` after the following rules:
  
* If intervalometer is ``OFF``, silent pics are named after last picture/movie taken without this function (e.g. ``12340001.422``). You are limited to 10000 silent pictures for each "noisy" picture.
* If intervalometer is ``ON``, silent pics have names like ``12345678.422``. Tip: use ``File Numbering -> Manual Reset`` from Canon menu to increase folder number (to sort them easier).
  
To convert a 422 image to JPEG on the PC, use one of the following programs:
  
* `422-jpg.py <https://bitbucket.org/hudson/magic-lantern/src/tip/422-jpg.py>`_ (command-line tool, runs on all platforms, you need to install Python, PIL and numpy).
* `422toimage <http://groups.google.com/group/ml-devel/browse_thread/thread/ae65535fc3e860fc>`_ (Windows only, `source code available <https://bitbucket.org/mindogas/422toimage/>`_).
* `YUV422 Convertor <http://www.diazonline.be/yuv422/>`_ (Windows only, closed source).
  
Known bugs:
  
* FullHD option will cause errors during playback; they are caused by dummy videos which were removed by ML, but camera thinks they are still there. After restart, the errors will disappear.
* Burst mode may cause a horizontal cut in the images; this happens because LiveView buffers are updated faster than card writing speed, and ML can't slow them down.
  
.. _mirror lockup:
.. _MLU:

Mirror Lockup
`````````````
  
Mirror lockup. See Canon user guide for details.
  
``Timer+Remote`` will auto-enable MLU under one of the following conditions (and disable it otherwise):
    
* self-timer mode is on (either 2 second or 10 second, but not continuous)
* `LCDsensor Remote`_ is in ``Away`` mode.
    
Expo
~~~~

.. _image settings:

.. figure:: ExpoMenu-550D.png
    :align: center
    :width: 5cm

Adjusting the exposure parameters. Most of these settings only work in Manual (photo and video), and some of them work in P, Av and Tv too.

.. _ISO:
.. _night vision:
.. _display gain:

ISO
```

Advanced ISO control.

Color coding:
  
* orange = pure analog ISO (100, 200 ... 3200)
* green = ISO with negative digital gain (160, 320 ... 2500)
* red = ISO with positive digital gain (avoid these values)

Submenu options:

* Analog ISO
* Canon digital ISO
* ML digital ISO (DIGIC) - in movie mode
* Display Gain (night vision) - in photo mode
* Highlight Tone Priority (which increases dynamic range by 1 stop)
* ISO selection (Canon ISOs or ML ISOs)
* Min Movie AutoISO
* Max Movie AutoISO
* AutoISO speed: for movie mode, this setting controls how fast ISO is changed automatically.

.. _White balance:
.. _WhiteBalance:
.. _Kelvin white balance:

WhiteBalance
````````````

Advanced white balance control. The preferred method is Kelvin white balance (range: 1500...15000 K).
  
Submenu options:
  
* Kelvin white balance
* WBShift G/M: Green-Magenta white balance shift. Useful for fluorescent lighting.
* WBShift B/A: Blue-Amber white balance shift. 1 unit = 5 mireks on Kelvin axis, according to `this post <http://www.openphotographyforums.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-5450.html>`_.
* Custom RGB multipliers: fine-tune custom white balance
* Auto adjust Kelvin + G/M: in LiveView, ML will compute the white balance for the current scene, using the center (200x200 pixels rectangle) as reference gray.

.. _shutter:

Shutter
```````

Fine-tune shutter speed.

* In photo mode, Magic Lantern displays shutter values rounded to 2 significant digits (e.g. 1/50 may be displayed by ML as 1/48). This is not a bug.
* In movie mode, shutter values are displayed with 3 exact digits (for example, in PAL mode, Canon uses 1/33.333 to avoid flicker).
* To use shutter speeds normally not available in Canon firmware (like 1/25 or 1/8000 in movie mode), enable `exposure override`_.

Aperture
````````

Adjust aperture. When `exposure override`_ is enabled, you can adjust it in 1/8-stop increments.

PictureStyle
````````````

Change picture style or adjust its parameters.
  
REC PicStyle
````````````

You can use a different picture style when recording (toggled automagically). May be useful with flat picture styles.

.. _flash exposure compensation:
.. _Flash AEcomp:

Flash AEcomp
````````````

Flash exposure compensation. Theoretical range: -10..+3 EV.
  
Warning: values lower than -5 may not work well.
  
Tip: you may use -10EV to trigger an external flash without putting light on the scene coming from the onboard flash.

.. _exposure override:

Exp.Override
````````````

This mode bypasses Canon exposure limitations (for ISO, Tv, Av). It enables:
 
* Manual video exposure controls in cameras without it (500D, 50D, 1100D).
* 1/25s in movie mode (24p/25p) -> 1/3 stops better in low light.
* 1/8000s in movie mode, `useful for slow motion <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztuUh3bgqA>`_.
* ISO 12800 is allowed in movie mode on 60D and 600D.
* Full-time DOF preview in photo mode, without blocking certain keys.

Settings:

* OFF: Canon default exposure mode.
* ON: ML overrides exposure values (change them from Expo menu).
* Auto: ML enables it only when needed:

  - For 500D, 50D, 1100D: in movie mode, to enable manual exposure controls.
  - For 60D: in Manual mode with a manual lens, to fix the `LiveView underexposure bug <http://groups.google.com/group/ml-devel/browse_thread/thread/f1c9cb4ff163808c>`_.
  - For 550D/60D/600D/5D2: when you select a shutter speed, aperture or ISO value which is not available in standard firmware (e.g. 1/25s or 1/8000s in movie mode).

Side effect: in photo mode, anything slower than 1/25 seconds will be underexposed in LiveView.

Focus
~~~~~

.. figure:: FocusMenu-550D.png
    :align: center
    :width: 5cm

 
.. _trap focus:

Trap Focus
``````````

[[http://www.flickr.com/photos/ml_kap/5404489873|{{ TrapFocus-Hummingbird.jpg?200}}]]

Takes a picture when the subject comes into focus. You need to set the to Manual focus (MF) and hold the shutter pressed halfway.
  
* Outside LiveView, it only works with lenses with chip.
* In LiveView it only works for photos, and it will take a picture 
  when the focus indicator has (almost) maximum value on the focus graph. 
    
Notes for LiveView trap focus:
    
- You may have to turn the lens back and forth a few times in order to let ML
  compute the correct focus scaling factor for the current scene. 
- If you move from a high-contrast scene to a low-contrast one, you will also have to wait a bit until the high-contrast data disappears from the focus graph.
- Press ``SET`` to temporarily disable automatic scaling of focus magnitude.

.. _AF patterns:

Focus Patterns
``````````````

Custom focus patterns which can be used either with autofocus or `trap focus`_.
  
.. figure:: AFP.png
    :align: center
    :width: 11.8cm
  
To change the focus pattern:
  
* Set your camera in photo mode, non-LiveView;
* Look through the viewfinder and make sure the main display is off;
* Change the focus pattern with the arrow keys and ``SET``; you may or may not receive visual feedback.
* Press the ``Zoom In`` button twice to see the current selection.

You can use the custom focus patterns in LiveView Quick Focus mode, too, but the pattern won't be displayed on the screen.

This feature was ported from `400plus <http://code.google.com/p/400plus/>`_.

.. _follow focus:

Follow Focus
````````````

Very simple follow focus (like a rack focus controlled manually).
  
* ``Arrows``: you will be able to focus with the arrow keys.
* ``LCD Sensor``: on 550D/500D, focus by placing your hand near the LCD sensor (avoiding shake). To use this, you may need to disable `LCDsensor Remote`_.

Recommended focus step settings: 
  
* Focus StepSize: 1 or 2
* Focus StepDelay: small values, without ``Wait`` flag.
* If the motion is not smooth, try larger delays (100ms)

Quick rack focus **while recording**:

* Press ``MENU`` to save current focus point (this means "I want to return here");
* Use follow focus to change focus point (focus somewhere else);
* Press ``PLAY`` to go to saved focus point;
* Press ``PLAY`` again to go back.

.. _focus speed:

Focus StepSize
``````````````

Step size for one focus command, as used by EOS Utility.

Focus StepDelay
```````````````

Delay between two successive focus commands, with an optional waiting flag.
  
* If ``Wait`` is not active, ML will only wait a for fixed delay before sending next focus command. This will reduce stutter, but may affect rack focus accuracy. This setting is recommended if you only use follow focus.

* If ``Wait`` is active, ML will wait until each focus command is completed, and then it will wait for a fixed delay, as configured here. This will increase rack focus accuracy, but may cause stutter with certain lenses.

.. _rack focus:

Focus End Point
```````````````
  
This is end point of rack focus (X focus steps from the start point, i.e. from current focus point).
  
First you have to set the end point. Focus the lens, then press ``SET`` on this menu item.
  
After pressing SET, ML will display ``Focus End Point: 0 steps from here.``.
This means the end point is now assigned to current focus position.
  
At this point, you will see the LiveView image and set the start point using left and right keys (just like with `follow focus`_) or the main dial (scrollwheel).
The start point will be always the current focus point (which you are changing); the end point will remain fixed.
  
Rack Focus
``````````

Triggers the rack focus operation that moves between the start and end focus points. After the move is complete pressing again reverses the move. 
    
* ``SET``: rack focus will start after 2 seconds;
* ``Q``: rack focus will start immediately;
* ``PLAY``: ML will automatically record a short clip with the rack focus operation.

Step-by-step:
  
1. Pick the end point of rack focus by focusing on it (manually or with AF).

2. Configure focus parameters (step size and delay). Different lenses may require different parameters.

3. Open the ``Focus`` menu, go to ``Focus End Point`` and press ``Set`` to zero it out.
  
4. Pick the start point by focusing on it with the left/right buttons while the Focus menu is active. Make sure the number from ``Focus End Point`` is changing as you focus. Fine-tune the position with scrollwheel.
    
5. Go to ``Rack Focus`` and press ``SET``, ``Q`` or ``PLAY`` to start rack focus.
  
6. To return to the beginning point, run rack focus again.
  
Tip: when `LCDsensor Remote`_ is set on ``Near`` or ``Away``, you can trigger rack focus from the LCD sensor, avoiding shake.

Recommended focus step settings: 
  
* Focus StepSize: 1 or 2
* Focus StepDelay:
  - without ``Wait`` flag: large delays (around 100 ms) => will ignore small position errors
  - with ``Wait`` flag: small delays (only lens is in very good mechanical condition)

.. _focus stacking:

Stack focus
```````````

{{ vimeo>5879032??250x140}}

This selection will shoot a series of photographs with varying focus points.
It is used in macro photography to assemble sharper final images by merging photos where each has a different focus point. 

This function will also create scripts named like named ``FST_1234.SH``, which can be used for stacking the images with enfuse. See `Exposure bracketing`_ for details on how to use these scripts, and the `focus stacking section <http://panorama.dyndns.org/EandE-documentation/enfuse.html#Focus-Stacks>`_ from Enfuse reference manual.
  
Usage:
  
1. Configure `rack focus`_ and use it to preview the focus range. 
2. Select the number of focus steps to skip. This will determine the number of pictures to be taken.
3. Press PLAY to start the focus sequence (``PLAY`` mode) or take the first picture (``SNAP`` mode).
  
You can also combine this function with `HDR`_ bracketing and `silent pictures`_.

Recommended focus step settings: same as for `rack focus`_.

.. _focus and DOF info:

The following items are display only:

Focus Dist
``````````

The distance to the focal point. Value is returned by most newer Canon lenses. If the lens does not report any distance information, 0 will be displayed and the DOF calculations will not be correct. 
    
See also [[Focus distance]].

Hyperfocal
``````````

The hyperfocal distance is the point of focus where everything from half that distance to infinity falls within the depth of field. This is the largest depth of field possible for the current f-number. 

DOF Near
````````

The nearest distance in which objects appear in focus. 

DOF Far
```````

The farthest distance in which objects appear in focus. 

Tweaks
~~~~~~

.. figure:: TweakMenu-550D.png
    :align: center
    :width: 5cm

Miscellanous settings.

Sticky DOF Preview
``````````````````

This will make the DOF preview button sticky (so you no longer have to hold it pressed).
  
Note: enabling DOF preview will block certain buttons.
  
Tip: enable `Exposure Override`_ to preview DOF without blocking the buttons.

Sticky HalfShutter
``````````````````

This will make the half-shutter press sticky (so you no longer have to hold it pressed).

Tip: you can use this setting for:

* Trap focus without having to hold the shutter. You will need to assign AF to half-shutter button.
* Disabling powersaving in LiveView (so the camera doesn't turn off after 30 minutes).

**Focus box: Show / AutoHide**

Control the appearance of focus box:
  
* Show: show the focus box in LiveView (just like the standard firmware)
* AutoHide: the focus box is only displayed when you move it, and then it disappears after 1 second or so.

.. _SensorShortcuts:

LCD Sensor Shortcuts
````````````````````

Enables the use of LCD sensor as an extra shift key (trigger for arrow key shortcuts).

To fully disable the LCD sensor in Magic Lantern, disable ``LCD auto off`` from Canon menu (Wrench 1). You need to do this if you are using a device which covers the LCD sensor (e.g. a loupe).

.. _Auto Burst PicQ:

Auto BurstPicQuality
````````````````````

When enabled, it will temporarily reduce picture quality in burst mode in order to maintain a decent frame rate even when the buffer becomes almost full. 
  
This function will reduce picture quality if the buffer has space for less than 4 pictures:

* ``RAW+JPG`` -> ``JPG Large Fine`` -> ``JPG Medium Fine``
* ``RAW`` -> ``JPG Large Fine`` -> ``JPG Medium Fine``
* ``JPG Large Coarse`` -> ``JPG Medium Coarse``
  
Possible results (550D, Transcend Class 10, your mileage may vary):
  
* ``RAW+JPG``, ``JPG-L``, all others ``JPG-M``
* ``RAW``, ``RAW``, all others ``JPG-M``

.. _ISO selection:

ISO selection
`````````````

* ``All values``: use all available ISO speeds, in 1/8 EV steps
* ``100x, 160x``: use only native ISOs (multiples of 100) and ISO values with lower digital gain (multiples of 160).

Crop Factor Display
```````````````````

If enabled, ML bottom bar will display the 35mm equivalent focal length, including crop factor (1.6x).
  
For example, a 50mm lens at f1.8 will be displayed as:
  
* ``50 f/1.8`` with this option disabled;
* ``80eq/1.8`` with this option enabled.
  
Swap MENU <-> ERASE (60D)
`````````````````````````

Swaps ``MENU`` and ``ERASE`` buttons. This feature allows one-handed navigation in ML menu on 60D, but will have to use ``MENU`` button to delete the pictures.

.. _zoom in Face Detect mode:

LiveView Zoom
`````````````

Fine-tune Canon's zoom feature (5x/10x) in LiveView. 
  
You can disable one of those two settings, enable zoom in Face Detection mode, or increase sharpness/contrast when you zoom in.


Play
~~~~

Features for Playback mode.

Image review mode
`````````````````
  
* ``QuickReview``: just like in standard firmware
* ``Hold->Play``: if you set ``Image Review: Hold`` in Canon menu, it will go to ``PLAY`` mode instead. This allows you to zoom in as soon as you take the picture (without having to press ``PLAY``). Credits goto Ken Rockwell for suggesting this.

Zoom in PLAY mode
`````````````````

Increase the speed of zoom function in ``PLAY`` mode.

Free Memory
```````````

Displays the amount of available RAM.

.. _CMOS temperature:

CMOS temperature
````````````````

Displays the internal CMOS temperature, in raw units.

.. _shutter count:

Shutter Count
`````````````

Displays the number of shutter actuations.


Powersave
~~~~~~~~~

.. _Dim display:

Dim display
```````````

In LiveView, if the camera is idle, Magic Lantern will reduce the LCD backlight level to minimum in order to save power.

.. _Turn off display:

Turn off LCD and LV
```````````````````

In LiveView, if the camera is idle, Magic Lantern will turn off the built-in LCD display and pause LiveView (turn off the sensor) in order to save power. If the camera is recording or motion detection is active, only display will be turned off.

Turn off GlobalDraw
```````````````````

In LiveView, if the camera is idle, Magic Lantern will turn off `Global Draw`_ in order to save power.

Battery remaining
`````````````````

60D and 5D Mark II only: displays battery percentage, estimated time remaining and battery discharging rate.
  
For accurate readings, wait until the percentage indicator decreases by at least 2% since powering on.

Config
~~~~~~

Magic Lantern saves its settings in a configuration file named `magic.cfg`_. This menu lets you customize how these settings are saved.

Config AutoSave
```````````````

If enabled, settings are saved automatically to ``magic.cfg`` whenever you change a setting in ML menu.
  
Config saving process will take place as soon as you close the menu.

Save config now
```````````````
  
Saves ML settings to ``magic.cfg``.

Delete config file
``````````````````
  
Deletes ``magic.cfg``, which will restore ML default settings at next boot. 
  
Note: This item will disable ``Config AutoSave`` for the current session, in order to make sure the config file won't be re-created when you close the menu.

.. _display preset:

DISP presets
````````````

This feature lets you use up to 4 display presets for the settings in the `LiveV`_ menu.

On the top bar, you will see ``DISP`` 0, 1, 2 or 3. Each of those is a preset for the settings in ``LiveV`` menu. So you can, for example, configure ``DISP 1`` with false colors, ``DISP 2`` with zebras and focus peaking, and ``DISP 3`` with clear display.

This menu item sets the maximum number of available DISP presets. To disable this feature, set the number of presets to 1.

Power saving
------------

Magic Lantern can help you maximize battery life while shooting, which also results in reduced overheat.

If you enable many CPU-intensive functions for `LiveV`_ menu, the battery may drain a bit faster.

To save power, you may:

* `Turn off display`_ in LiveView mode;
* Dim the display when idle;
* Turn off `Global Draw`_ when idle;
* Quickly adjust LCD backlight level (LCD sensor + up/down).

If you have a 60D, you can `measure power consumption with this autoexec <http://bit.ly/ml-nov23>`_.
