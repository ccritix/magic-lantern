If you are not comfortable with this, stop reading and delete the
software before you are tempted to try running it on your camera.
Especially with this early release for the Canon 550D / T2i,
there is no guarantee that things will work.

Please see the LICENSE file for additional terms that cover
distribution of this software.

To repeat this important point:

IMPORTANT NOTES

* If you have a bootable CF/SD card and have the DISKBOOT flag
  set in the camera (which the installer does), and you do not
  have an AUTOEXEC.BIN file on the card the camera WILL NOT BOOT.
  It will hang and not wake up until the battery is removed.

* If you encounter a "locked up" camera, quickly remove the battery.
  Otherwise the ARM might be in a tight-loop and get very hot, very quickly.
  Your battery will run down and your LCD might show some discoloration.

* When in doubt, remove the battery and reboot.

* And, remember that this software can damage or destroy your camera.
