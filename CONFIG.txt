Magic Lantern 0.2 for Canon 550D, Firmware 1.0.9
================================================

Configuration file
------------------

The configuration file (MAGIC.CFG) lets you tweak various hidden settings
using a simple text editor (Notepad, gedit, vi...), and is also used
to save Magic Lantern configuration from the GUI menu.

When you install Magic Lantern, it is recommended to start with a fresh
configuration file (i.e. delete all *.CFG files from the card), 
because default settings may be changed in the new release.

Saving settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From the Magic Lantern menu, choose Debug -> Save config. 
Your config file will be overwritten with current Magic Lantern settings.
Comments from the file will be removed!

Hidden settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These settings can not be changed from the ML menu, so they are documented here::

    # if set to 1, disable the bootdisk flag
    magic.disable_bootdiskf = 0

    # Cropmarks file (todo: move it to the menu... how to use FindFirst/FindNext?)
    crop.file = B:/cropmark.bmp

    # Draw a property value
    debug.dump_prop = 0x1060003

    # Controls the refresh rate for zebra & friends (delay in ms between updates)
    zebra.delay = 1000

    # Limits allowed for qscale control. Since negative values are not allowed in config file, 
    # put the absolute values here. Also, qscale can take now only negative values.
    h264.qscale.max.neg = 1
    h264.qscale.max.neg = 16
