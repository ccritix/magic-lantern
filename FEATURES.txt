* For stack focus, you have first to go to Live View, then to Play mode, 
  make sure you have an image, then back to Live View.
* Bitmap overlay palette is fully initialized only after performing 
  the above steps.
* Sometimes the menu gets overwritten by Canon's drawing routines. 
* After closing ML menu, screen may not redraw automatically 
  (half-press the shutter to trigger a redraw)

  camera (if it happens, restart it). 
* Boot menu entries may be dangerous => be careful with them!
