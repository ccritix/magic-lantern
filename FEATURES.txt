Magic Lantern 0.2 for Canon 550D, Firmware 1.0.9
================================================

Features
--------

* GUI menus: press the ERASE button to display them
* Bit rate control (QScale parameter) for H.264 encoder
* Display time remaining during video recording
* Zebra stripes for overexposed / underexposed areas
* Simple intervalometer
* Remote release with the LCD sensor (i.e. put your hand near the LCD to take a pic) 
* AE bracketing (like on 5D2 ML) 
* Stack focus (see issues)
* Lens data computation 
* Onscreen audio meters
* Manual audio gain, selectable input source 
* Debug functions (event, property and debug logging, display CMOS temperature)

Known issues
------------

* For stack focus, you have first to go to Live View, then to Play mode, 
  make sure you have an image, then back to Live View.
* Bitmap overlay palette is fully initialized only after performing 
  the above steps.
* If you start the camera in LiveView mode, histogram and zebra may not show.
  If this happens, press MENU twice to get them.
* Sometimes the menu gets overwritten by Canon's drawing routines. 
* After closing ML menu, screen may not redraw automatically 
  (half-press the shutter to trigger a redraw)
* Time remaining for video is meaningless if QScale control is enabled
  (maybe it should be calibrated with the real-time clock?)
* Playing with debug options may lead to strange behaviors of the
  camera (if it happens, restart it). 
* Boot menu entries may be dangerous => be careful with them!

Menu options
------------

Audio
~~~~~

Audio tweaks.

**AudioMeter: ON/OFF**
  Draw the audio meters or not.

**Output vol (dB)**
  ??? (I can't hear anything)

**Analog Gain (dB)**
  Recording volume maybe?

**L-Gain and R-Gain (dB)**
  Digital gain maybe?

**AGC: ON/OFF**
  Enable/disable Automatic Gain Control. Turn this to OFF to prevent hiss noise when recording silence.

**Filters: ON/OFF**
  Enable/disable digital audio filters (High Pass Filter, Low Pass Filter and stereo emphasis)

**Inp**
  Input source: Internal mic, int L ext R, ext stereo, int L ext L+R (balanced).

Video
~~~~~

Video overlays: histogram, zebras, cropmarks, spotmeter.

**Global Draw: ON/OFF**
  Enable/disable drawing extra graphics elements 
  (zebra, cropmarks, histogram, spotmeter, audio meters)

**Histogram: ON/OFF**
  Show a histogram for the luma (Y) channel of the LiveView image. Colorspace is YUV.

**Zebras: ON/OFF**
  Enable/disable zebra stripes, which indicate overexposed or underexposed areas.

**ZebraThrLO, ZebraThrHI**
  Thresholds for underexposure and overexposure. 
  Brightness values are between 0 and 255.

**CropM**
  Enable/disable cropmarks. 
  Todo: cycle to all available cropmarks. For now, select the cropmark from the config file, 
  option "crop.file". See [[Cropmarks]].

**Spotmeter**
  Measure brightness in the center of the frame, and display it as a percentage.
  Indicator is at the bottom on the screen, centered horizontally.

**Clear Screen**
  Delete any junk which might be left on the screen.

Shoot
~~~~~

Functions for stills shooting.

**IntervalTime**
  Time delay for intervalometer, in seconds.

**Intervalometer: ON/OFF**
  Start/stop intervalometer. 

**LCD RemoteShot: ON/OFF**
  Start/stop shutter release with the LCD sensor. To take a picture, 
  put your hand near the LCD sensor. 

  This is useful for avoiding camera shake without extra $$$
  
  To use it, select one of P,S,A,M modes, turn OFF Live View, 
  and make sure "LCD auto off" is enabled (in the Canon menu, wrench 1).

You can also stop the intervalometer and remote shooting mode
by pressing PLAY or MENU.

Brack
~~~~~
AE bracketing.

**Test bracket**
  Take a few pictures with the selected settings.

**AE count**
  Number of pictures to take.

**AE step**
  Number of AE steps between two shots.
  
  How big is an AE step? 
  
  This feature is still buggy, and seems to work only in AV mode.

See also [[Focus distance]].

Debug
~~~~~

**QScale**
  Controls the H.264 QScale parameter, which affects video bitrate. 
  Lower values mean higher bitrates. OFF should disable QScale control.
  See [[Bit rate]] wiki page for details.

**Save config**
  Save current settings to MAGIC.CFG.

**CMOS temp**
  Temperature of the CMOS sensor, in raw units.

**Draw palette**
